# Lightcube
 
In my grade 11 computer enginnering class we created light cubes by soddering together LEDs and connecting them to an arduino. I take no repsonsibility for the idea, it was Mr. French who introduced us to this awesome project and walked us through it. The setup/layer/LightITUp/lightUpCube functions are not mine. What I am responsible for is creating the patterns in the lightcube. I'm expecially proud of the rain function, and I also programed a sparkle function as well as another two hardcoded patterns.
